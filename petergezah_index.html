		<h2>Personal Information</h2>

		<p> Hello! My name is Peter, and I am a master's student currently pursuing a Degree in Data Science and AI from
			the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool</a>. I have always been interested in the
			intersection of technology and business, and my studies have provided me with a solid foundation in data
			science and analytics.

			During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on projects that have allowed me to develop and apply my
			skills. For example, the Predictive maintenance of aircraft engines using machine learning. This project
			allowed me to develop the ability to interpret and present data in a clear and concise manner.

			In addition to my coursework, I have also pursued additional learning opportunities, such as <a

			and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/XCKCED4K87ZE">Cousera</a>. This
			has allowed me to stay current with the latest advancements in the field and expand my skill set.</p>
